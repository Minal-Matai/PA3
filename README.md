Design Thinking Final Passion Project

Emphasize: A senior resident who has health issues (diabetes and high cholestrol) who needs to keep track of the types of food they buy and keep track of finances.

Research: 
- The senior residents at Chesterbrook would always talk about what foods and snacks they were buying from Trader Joes and how they always wanted to eat sugary treats. But, as a result, they would continuously have to go to doctor appointments and keep a blood sugar tracker to ensure good health.
- My grandma, who also lives in a senior home, has recently been buying a lot of sugary treats (scons, honey, etc.), but her blood sugar has sky-rocketed and now she has a very strict diet and regular check ups

-The biggest cuisines seniors love are Italian, Chinese, or Mexican. The mst popular meals are pizza, soup, and bananas.

Problem Solution:
-Create a program where a senior can input the foods they need and the approximate price of each thing. The program will organize each thing into a diet
chart and measure how healthy or unhealthy the food items from the store are. The program will also create a budget tracker to keep count of everything.

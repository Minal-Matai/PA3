Design Thinking Final Passion Project

Emphasize: A senior resident who has health issues (diabetes and high cholestrol)  needs to keep track of the types of food they buy and keep track of managing finances. A lot of seniors spend the bulk of their money on snacks and sweets which are not beneficial to their health and well-being.

Research: 
- The senior residents at Chesterbrook would always talk about what foods and snacks they were buying from Trader Joes and how they always wanted to eat sugary treats. But, as a result, they would continuously have to go to doctor appointments and keep a blood sugar tracker to ensure good health.
- My grandma, who also lives in a senior home, has recently been buying a lot of sugary treats (scons, honey, etc.), but her blood sugar has sky-rocketed and now she has a very strict diet and regular check ups
-The biggest cuisines seniors love are Italian, Chinese, or Mexican. The mst popular meals are pizza, soup, and bananas.
-Senior residents should be eating meals with a plate made of half of vegetables and fruit, a quarter of carbs, and a quarter of protein.

Problem Solution Ideas:
-Create a program where a senior can input the foods they need to buy and the approximate price of each thing. 
-The program could organize each food item into a diet chart and measure how healthy or unhealthy the food items from the store are. 
-The program will also create a budget tracker to keep count of everything and make suggestions to the user of what to use any spare money on or what to spend less money on.
-The program could also create a chart where each food is organized in to, and instead of the program making suggestions to the user, the user has the chance to move, add, or remove items however they see fit in an interactive game.
-The program could be more educational-oriented, with the computer giving the user "minilessons" on nutrition value and how to implement it with a quiz at the end.

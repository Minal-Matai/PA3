Design Thinking Final Passion Project

Emphasize: A senior resident who has health issues (diabetes and high cholestrol) needs to keep track of the types of food they buy and keep track of managing finances. A lot of seniors spend the bulk of their money on snacks and sweets which are not beneficial to their health and well-being.

Research: 
- During my experience at Chesterbrook, the senior residents would always talk about what foods and snacks they were buying from Trader Joes and other stores and how they constantly bought sugary treats and other snacks. But, as a result, they would continuously have to go to doctor appointments and keep a blood sugar tracker to ensure good health. This can be very unhealthy for senior lifestyle all because their grocery lists are not structured in a nutritional manner.
- My grandma, who also lives in a senior home, has recently been buying a lot of sugary foods (scones, cookies, etc.), but her blood sugar has sky-rocketed and now she is required to follow a very strict diet and have regular check ups.
-The biggest cuisines seniors love are Italian, Chinese, or Mexican. The most popular meals are pizza, soup, and bananas.
-Senior residents should be eating meals made of a plate with half of vegetables and fruit, a quarter of carbs, and a quarter of protein.

Problem Solution Ideas:
-Create a program where a senior can input the foods they need to buy and the approximate price of each thing. 
-The program could organize each food item into a diet chart and measure how healthy or unhealthy the food items from the store are. 
-The program will also create a budget tracker to keep count of everything and make suggestions to the user of what to use any spare money on or what to spend less money on.
-The program could also create a chart where each food is organized in to, and instead of the program making suggestions to the user, the user has the chance to move, add, or remove items however they see fit in an interactive game.
-The program could be more educational-oriented, with the computer giving the user "minilessons" on nutrition value and how to implement it with a quiz at the end.

Reflection
-What went well: The idea that I built off of for this program was very strong and included all the aspects we covered in comp-sci 3. I also think writing the code itself was way better than previous codes since I worked off of my previous projects. I also think the packages I imported that I was not familiar with before (matplotlib and tabulate) were so much easier to implement than I imagined because there were so many resources I could work off of.
-What could be better: I think the conciseness of my code (again) and the in-code comments could be much more stronger. Also some of my code processes are reptitive, so creating better functions that incorporate these parts could improve the readability of my program.
-If I had more time: If I had more time I would implement the tkinter package to make user experience more engaging and visually appealing. I would also organize my code a lot better and go through each line to clarify variable names, create new functions for repetitiveness, and improve some of the instructions and other print statements. I would also work on making the console (specifically for the editing the dictionary part) look better.
